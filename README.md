# Cheats

My personal cheat sheets for [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi), the
CLI interactive cheat sheet utility.

You *can* clone my / other people's cheat sheets very easily. But I *highly*
recommend just building your own. 

Even if this means manually copying sheets from other peoples repos. Otherwise
you'll just end up with a stack of commands, which almost certainly will lead 
you to:

- feeling a bit lost as you don't know what you have
- executing code directly in your shell that you haven't personally
  verified! Yikes.
